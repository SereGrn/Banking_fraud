# Banking_fraud
This scoring project aims to detect fraudulent transactions.  The main objective is to find the best classifier that maximizes recall while handling highly unbalanced data.
In fact, the dataset contains 99% non-fraudulent transactions and 1% fraudulent transactions. 
I managed this imbalance using three different methods: 
- Use of penalized model 
- Use of an oversampling method (Smote algorithm)
- Boosting method 
 Finally, I created an API using Dash. This API presents the dataset used, the results of the different classifications, and allows to perform a query to predict with the trained models if a new transaction is a fraud or not. 
For size reasons, I could not upload the dataset used.
